# Participation Guidelines

Dhwani respects Mozilla's [community participation guidelines](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/governance/policies/participation/). These guidelines cover our behaviour as participants, mentors, experts, staff, volunteers, and anyone else involved in making Project Dhwani possible.

## How to treat each other

* Be respectful and value each other’s ideas, styles and viewpoints.
* Be direct but professional; we cannot withhold hard truths.
* Be inclusive and help new perspectives be heard.
* Appreciate and accommodate our many cultural practices, attitudes and beliefs.
* Be open to learning from others.
* Lead by example and match your actions with your words.

## Inclusion and Diversity

The Project Dhwani welcomes and encourages participation by everyone. It doesn’t matter how you identify yourself or how others perceive you: we welcome you.

We welcome contributions from everyone as long as they interact constructively with our community, including, but not limited to people of varied age, culture, ethnicity, gender, gender-identity, language, race, sexual orientation, geographical location and religious views. To know more on contributions, check out [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md) file.


## Raising Issues

If you believe you‘re experiencing practices which don‘t meet the above policies, or if you feel you are being harassed in any way, please immediately contact the current Project maintainer, Philomath or speak up in the community channels.

Community around the Project Dhwani reserves the right to refuse admission to anyone violating these policies, and/or take further action including expulsion from the program.
