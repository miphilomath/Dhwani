Dhwani
======

Dhwani is a smart assistant to help people, use their system efficiently who have difficulty in using the system in any way. Dhwani will be your personal assistant and a reliable friend, ready to help you and talk to you. Dhwani is inspired from the JARVIS, the personal assistant of Tony Stark in the Iron Man Series and competes with personal assistants in the market like Amazon Alexa and Google Home.

All personal assistants, available in the industry, sends all the data to their cloud servers to process and provide services to their customers. This architecture is good for enterprises as it allows them to take as much data about their customers with their consent by spying over them. Google and Amazon lies on top of the list for such companies.

For people, who wants to try and experience the power of evolving technology, using these personal assistant in their day to day life, without worrying about companies, selling or using their data without consent, Alexa and Google Home mini doesn't help. Their service will degrade if the data collection will be stopped. So, what can we do? Dhwani is the future of these assistant services and unlike these services will be open to all. 

### Backstory and Initial development
Ever since Iron Man, Jarvis is the dream of every one and with the advent of various industrial application of chatbots, Dhwani started to evolve as an Idea at a Hackathon (RajHack), and was dreamed to help backward and tribal communities in the state of Rajasthan, with computers in general and helping them to use government services.
Later modified, Dhwani's first prototype was developed by a team of four (@hellozee, @cocoa, @dunkenmaster and I) at another hackathon (streetHack). First prototype was a success, but was dependent on third party api services which we delegated at that time.

Special thanks to our contributors/developers that helped in kick-starting this project and to shape the dream of having our own personal assistant, a reality.
